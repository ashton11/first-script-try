            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a hungarian programmer, who has been learning Java for about a year now.
                I am well versed in Spring Boot and Security, MySQL, Continous Integration and Development, Jira and many more.
                Since I haven't landed a job yet I decided to learn JavaScript to refresh my basics in HTML and CSS while also broadening my knowledge.
                This is my not so very first website, but sadly I have to re-do all my work due to visibility issues.
                I am not a master of fancy pages (yet), but I will do my best to make this look as good as possible.
